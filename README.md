## **Background**

Currency has played a major role in society for thousands of years. Having an established currency was the mark of humanity's first step towards "functioning modern society". Countries all established different currencies, yet all mutually recognized gold as a valuable commodity. To facilitate trading, many countries adopted the gold standard or simply settled traded disputes with gold, since all countries had a common conception of gold's value. 
Gold's significance in the history of commerce and the maintained international understanding makes it the perfect benchmark to compare the buying power of different currencies. This project aims to draw insights from the buying power of different currencies using gold as the standard to determine each of their value. 


## **Procedures**
We gathered the data for the Average Hourly Wages from the majority of developed countries around the worldand and for the spot price of gold.

From:

## **Inference**


+ Mexico and Russsia had the lowest minimum wages over the years.

+ Netherlands and Luxembourg had the highest minimum wages over the years.

+ New Zealand and the UK are continuosly increasing the minimum wage over the years.



## **Conclusion**

+ This project used the gold price and U.S. dollar as currency to analyze the work hours to purchase the same amount of gold around the world, as this provides a clearer picture of the global economy. (the inverse of work hours = Purchasing Power)

+ Weak currency is related to more work hours to buy  1 oz of gold. (e.g. current (Nov. 14, 2020) 1 Mexico Peso = 0.049 USD ~ 20 times more  work hours of US)

+ Gold behaves like a currency, in a sense, so it is sensitive to changes in exchange rates between national fiat currencies and the divergence in monetary policies of the major central banks.
